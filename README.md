# Mula
Web application developed using PayPal API to help users manage their finances automatically and help them be prepared during crisis. For every transaction made using PayPal,  Mula rounds off to the nearest dollar, and stores them in a separate account. The user would not be able to draw the money until a specific goal has been reached.
